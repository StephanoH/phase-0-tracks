<!-- HTML5 semantic tags seemed designed to make documents much clearer in terms of what type of information is being displayed. The most useful seem to be the <nav> tag for creating separate elements common to a more general website instead of a specific article, and the <section> tag, which separates the overall larger article into coherent chapters, which helps with differentiating data when looking at the code itself.
	
Browsers work by decoding information in the document nested in specific tags, which gives it instructions on how to display the information itself. It starts with the <!DOCTYPE> in order to know which version of html is being used, and then proceeds downwards from there to decode the rest of the information.

I had come across snippets by Sublime accidentally a few times before when mistakenly pressing tab while typing the tag I wanted to use, although this was because I had downloaded Sublime 3 mistakenly at first, which opens snippets even without having completed a specific keyword (I think). I had typed in htm, then pressed tag, and it had filled out the rest of the template for me a few times, which I found pretty useful, if confused at first. As for creating snippets, that is a tool that I know would come in handy many times in the future, especially if designing multiple pages with the same layout, in which the only thing that is different is the data that is being displayed. 

The most challenging thing I had in this GPS was probably learning where to put content in the snippet template in Sublime, although my pair and I were able to figure it out by doing a quick Google Search. Just by knowing the specific syntax I could have avoided the problem altogether (like knowing what square brackets do), but by looking closely at the template it wasn't that hard to figure it out anyway. -->
