# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control allows for the tracking and management of changes to a file, useful for recognizing mistakes or keeping track of individual changes to a file by a group.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is a way to work on a file without risking damage to it by cloning it into a seperate environment and making sure any changes won't go back to the original.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit is a way to save the changes made to a file into the git. It is accompanied by a message that describes the changes that took place, such as a file being added.
* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict occurs when two people have modified the same line of code in different ways. When Git tries to merge them, it cannot distinguish which one is the correct modification, so it comes up as a merge conflict.
